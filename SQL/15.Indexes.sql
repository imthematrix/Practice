/*
Indexes are used by the sql queries to find the data quickly in the tables.
indexes are created in tables and views.

the existence of the right index greatly improves the performance.
In absense of an index, the query engine will have to cheeck each and every rows in the table from beginning to end.
This is called table scan, which is bad.
