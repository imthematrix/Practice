     Multi-level inheritence is valid iin C#

     i.e. before the child class cnstructor gets executed, base class constructor will execute.

             what is the basic difference between method hiding and method overrriding?
             1. method hiding may or may not use the new keyword while hiding the base class method, but method overriding will use the virtual keywork in base class method and override
                keyword in child class where overriding is happening
            2.  in case of method hiding, polymorphism can't be implemented. as the base class reference variable will always point to base class implementation, but in 
                method overriding, polymorphism can be implemented because, override keyworks ensure, base class implementation is overridden by child class's implentationa and in can 
                child classes implementation of that method is not available, only then it will go the  base class method implentation.
